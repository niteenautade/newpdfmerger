# newpdfmerger
There are many websites that allow you to combine multiple pdf's.

However, what if the pdf's are bulky and many in number? 

That is what drove me to write a pdfmerger that can combine multiple pdf's offline.

The file "newpdfmerger.jar" is the executable and is all you need to try the program.
